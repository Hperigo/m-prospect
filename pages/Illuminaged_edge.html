            <h4>Sosolimited was tasked to create an inspiring lobby experience for Akamai's new headquarters in Boston.</h4>
            <p>
            The visitor is met with a series of touch screens and an interactive light sculpture that gives an scale to Akamai's global operation. The Sculpture animation is driven by real data from Akamai's servers and a interactive touch screen application let's the visitor explore different data sets.

            <h3>Technical overview</h3>

            <p>My first task was to create an app that analyzes Akamai server data throughout the day. With a separate application we could make sure that the data was correct and start imagining how the LED sculpture would react to it.</p>

            <p>
            Once we understood the data format we started working on the final OpenFrameworks app. We experimented with different effects and having the ability to edit then on the fly was super important since we would only see the final LED structure at the very end of the project. Each scene was updated in parallel and then composited together into a framebuffer that you see at the upper left of the video bellow.

            <p>
                Another interesting experiment to the project was to add a Lua scripting API to the c++ app. With that functionality we could easily test different effects and if the pendants were mapped in the correct order without the need to re-compile the app every time.
