                In this interactive installation, visitors at the Planet Word museum are asked to answer three simple questions on touch screens: how many languages do they speak, what are these languages, and where do they currently live.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reaction to user interaction, an animation featuring colorful bubbles appears on screen. Each bubble represents a language and is connected to the illustration of a dot, which symbolizes speakers and where they live. Related languages were organized into groups of
                similar colors. If visitors would scroll through the connections, they would unfold the story of
                visitors that visited the museum prior to them.

                The particle system is using a verlet integration method on a secondary thread
            together with a space partition library made ( simon ). That way we were able
            to run the physics with around 40k particles even when doing particle to particle colision.

                After getting the particle system in a solid state, I moved my focus to making
            the 3D world. For rendering we simply used an instance system in OpenGL and a
            geometry shader technique for the line rendering.
