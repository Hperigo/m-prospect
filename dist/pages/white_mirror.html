                The White Mirror celebrates people’s ever present auras. The sculpture tracks movement through webcams and OpenCV. When two people cross each other, their auras "collide", creating an explosion of colour.

            <h3>Technical overview</h3>

            <p>To develop White Mirror, I was in charge of developing the OpenCV Tracking system. I worked alongside Dimitre Lima (dmtr.org) and the product designers of Spaces and Creatures.</p>

            <p>Because the installation received varying natural lighting throughout the day, we had to produce an intelligent system that divides the camera feed into several sub-tiles. If a specific tile doesn’t have a movement on it, its image would be used as the mask for background subtraction. This allowed us to generate tracking blobs that worked in the morning, noon and night.</p>
