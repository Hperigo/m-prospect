                <p>Grupo Jacto is a company owned by a very traditional family of Japanese immigrants, with that in mind FutureBrand created a new corporate identity based on the art of kirigami. Five icons were developed that would later be used to compose illustrations, infographics, etc..</p>

                <p>I was commissioned to develop a software that generates complex shapes using those 5 icons. The initial idea was to create a simple tool that creates the iconography based on a bezier path step function. The final result became something similar to Adobe Illustrator, with full bezier editing (add, delete, subdivide), brushes, ctrl+z, custom file saving and png/svg exports, all done in javascript and paper.js</p>
